Provide help (similar to help given in install process) to users during later
editing of realm files, e.g. when answer is '?'; this could later be made
specific to particular DBD engines, when polymorphism is incorporated.

Separate change password method for each DBD, using polymorphism.
This will make it easier to extend NHGRI::Db::Connector.
Also test for syntactically correct server/database options.

Consider using YAML or some other technique to encode DBI connect
parameters, e.g. PrintError, AutoCommit, etc. into realm files.  Can do this
more simply by just putting them all on one line, e.g.
DBI_PARAM=PrintError=>0, AutoCommit=>1, RaiseError=>1
or, in the style of NHGRI::Db::Connect:
ATTR PrintError=0
or just:
PrintError=0

Use some kind of simple encryption to obscure (obviously, can't really
protect) password?  Perhaps this should be optional?

-- Rejected ideas:

Rewrite to use Class::Std?

Have make process deal with environment variables that need to be set for
each DBD (this should also be handled polymorphically).  This will eliminate
any need to edit the source files before installing them.  [I now think this
is a system-level thing; this module should not deal with environment
variables at all.]
